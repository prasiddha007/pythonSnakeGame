- **Food Mechanic**: The snake eats food and grows in size.
- **Scoreboard**: Tracks both the current score and the high score, saved locally in `data.txt`.
- **Collision Detection**: Game resets when the snake hits a wall or itself.
- **Persistent High Score**: The highest score is saved between sessions.
